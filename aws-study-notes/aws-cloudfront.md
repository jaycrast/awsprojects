- CloudFront
    - Content Delivery Network
    - Origin is the source location of your content, S3 Origin or Custom Origin
    - Distribution is the configuration unit of CloudFront
    - Edge Location is the local cache of your data stored in edge locations
    - Regional Edge Cache is a larger version of an edge location, provides another layer of caching
    - 24 hour default TTL
    - you can set a minimum TTL and maximum TTL
    - Origin Header: Cache-Control max-age (seconds)
    - Origin Header: Expires (Data & Time)
    - cache invalidation invalidates any objects cached regardless of the TTL, applies to all edge locations
    

- AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
    - HTTPS uses SSL or TLS protocols to provide a layer of encryption oevr HTTP
    - Data is encrypted in-transit
    - servers can be authenticated using certificates to prove identity
    - signed by trusted authority (Certificate Authority)
    - ACM can create, renew, and deploy certificates
    - Supported AWS Services only, cloudfront, API Gateway and ALB, not EC2
    - SSL is supported by default with the cloudfront.net cname

- Lambda @ Edge
    - you can run lightweight Lambda at edge locations
    - adjust data between the viewer and origin
    - currently supports node.js and python
    - run in AWS public space
    - layers are not supported
    - different limits vs normal lambda functions
    - use cases: 
        - A/B Testing, viewer request function
        - migration between S3 origins, origin request function
        - different objects based on device, origin request function (mobile, desktop etc)
        - vary content by country, origin request function

- AWS Global Accelerator
    - similar to cloudfront
    - 2x anycast IP Addresses, 1.2.3.4 and 4.3.2.1 
        - allow a single IP to be in multiple locations, routing moves traffic to closest location
    - this connection goes from global accelerator edge location and transits across the aws global network direct fiber link
    - cloudfront moves the content closer to the customer with caching
    - global accelerator moves the AWS network closer to the customer, not just the content
    - connection enter at edge using anycast IPs and then transit over AWS backbone instead of public internet
    - can be used for NON HTTPs connection, cloudfront is ONLY for http/s content
